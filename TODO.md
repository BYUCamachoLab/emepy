# TODO

### Monitors 
- Allow 3D monitor collection
- Allow custom monitor location collection 
- Allow custom monitor location extraction 
- Allow custom monitor extraction in any plane
- Allow interpolation onto custom monitor grid
- Normalize fields

### Simulation
- Allow simulation x and y to have different dimensions
- Make more allowable dimensions >> 2.5Âµm
- Check for spurious modes
- Allow overlaps and EME propagation of various modes of different geometries

### Circuit
- Implement multiple/custom ports
- Implement easy use with simphony by users for circuit compatibility

### Examples
- MMI
- 2x2 power splitter
- Full circuit
- GDS Export Compatibility

### Docs
- All new structures
- Monitors
- New Lumerical api 
- New custom grid flexibility

### Coding Standard
- Rename variables in monitor updating code to make sense to users
- Cleanup doc strings
- Add comments throughout to make the algorithm more clear

### Long Term
- GDS Import
- GDS Output 
- Inverse Design
